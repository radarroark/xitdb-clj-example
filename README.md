This is a small example showing how to use [xitdb-java](https://github.com/radarroark/xitdb-java) from Clojure using java interop. There is also [xitdb-clj](https://github.com/codeboost/xitdb-clj) which is a more high-level wrapper library.

```
# run the example and save it to the file "main.db"
clj -X:file

# run the example completely in memory
clj -X:memory
```
